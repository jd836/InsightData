# InsightData
Solution of coding challenge for the application of insight data program


To Insight Data Program Team:

All solution code is included under InsightData/src.
WordCountMain.java CharTreeNode.java WordCount.java WordCountService.java are for the word count coding challenge.
RunningMedianMain.java RunningMedian.java are for the running median coding challenge.
Input files are included under InsightData/wc_input.
Output files are include under InsightData/wc_output.
The solution can be simply run by "./run.sh" under Linux(Ubuntu) environment.

The solution of word count can process as large as 2GB text file. 
Running median code can read less than 2^30 files. Though there is no limit on the size of file, but this can only process files with less than 2^30 words per line.

Those may or may not satisfy your requirement. Since the time is limited, this is the best I can achieve before due. Thanks for consideration anyway! Also thanks for your time viewing my solution.
